- My current workplace is a dynamic hub of creativity and technological innovation where I wear two hats. As a React.js / Next.js developer, I build engaging and user-friendly websites, breathing life into digital experiences.

- Beyond development, I am passionate about empowering the next generation of tech enthusiasts. As an instructor, I guide students through the ever-evolving landscape of technology, focusing on exciting areas like AI tools and cutting-edge libraries.

- My days are a blend of crafting elegant code and fostering a love for learning in others. This unique environment allows me to constantly stay ahead of the curve while contributing to a community passionate about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the digital world.
